# RedisBatchPush

This gem provide a simple way to:

1. watch a data in a redis queue
2. cache this data (buffer)
3. process this buffered data by time

## Motivation

Sometimes you have a webserver that expect some data to come, and you have to save this data in a database. But this webserver receive a lot of requests per second, and saving in database is very expensive.

example:

your server receives:

```
POST /view -d '{id: 1}'
POST /view -d '{id: 1}'
POST /view -d '{id: 2}'
POST /view -d '{id: 1}'
POST /view -d '{id: 3}'
```

and for each post you should do

```
model = Table.find(id)
model.view += 1
model.save
```

with this gem you can reduce your data to make one incr by id

```
# in post
redis.lpush queue, view

# in other work
runner = RedisBatchPush::Runner.new(redis_client, queue, max_size, max_interval_sec)
runner.run do |views|
  views_by_id = views.inject({}) do |memo, item|
    memo[item["id"]] ||= 0
    memo[item["id"]] += 1
  end

  # Now you have to make 3 incr, 1 by id
  print views_by_id

  # {
  #   "1" => 3,
  #   "2" => 1,
  #   "3" => 1,
  # }
end

```
